## ProcEmu
A processor emulator application, allowing electronics / engineering students to emulate Single Cycle, 
Multi Cycle, Pipeline processors and their respective components (ALU, Controller, ALU Controller, 
various memories, Program Counter) to be inspected at each emulated clock and/or instruction.
It also contains its own assembler to assemble instructions into binary code that is loaded in the
Instruction Memory (if Single Cycle / Pipeline).
